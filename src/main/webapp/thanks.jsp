        This website was made possible by many hours of volunteer work and the
        kindness of others.  In particular, we would like to recognize several
        individuals and organizations for their support.
        </p>
        <h1>Contributors</h1>
        <p>
          To begin, this web site would not be possible without the research and dedication of
          George Pouder, who wrote the self-published book
          <a href="http://www.northcastlelibrary.org/historical-resources/North%20Castle's%20Civil%20War%20Soldiers.pdf">Soldier, Rest</a>.
          This book and the information contained within formed the basis of this web site.
        </p><p>
          This web site was conceived of and organized by Eagle Scout Candidate Jack Skiera
          as a way to contribute back to the community. Over the course of the project
          many other Boy Scouts and volunteers gave their time to help edit the available
          information about veterans, take pictures, and enter the information online.
        </p><p>
          We would also like to thank Tony Rippy, who provided technical guidance for the project
          and helped with the implementation of the web site itself.
        </p>
        <h1>Organizations</h1>
        <p>
          We would like to thank the organizational sponsor of this project, the
          <a href="http://www.northcastlehistoricalsociety.org/">North Castle Historical Society</a>.
          This project would not be possible without their support and guidance.
        </p><p>
          In addition we would like to recognize the support of the
          <a href="http://www.scouting.org/">Boy Scouts of America</a>. This web site was built as
          part of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)">Eagle Scout</a>
          program, which is organized and supported by the BSA.
          In particular, this project was supported by the
          <a href="http://www.wpcbsa.org/">Westchester-Putnam Council</a>,
          <a href="http://www.wpcbsa.org/muscoot">Muscoot District</a>,
          Troop 94, Scoutmaster Felix Carcano and Assistant Scoutmaster Rich Skiera.
        </p>
        <h1>Services</h1>
        <p>
          This web site makes heavy use of the
          <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>.
          We would like to thank <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>
          for providing free or low-cost tiers of service that make small web sites
          like this one possible, while taking advantage of Google's scale and reliability.
        </p><p>
          In its administrative pages, the site uses the
          <a href="https://www.tinymce.com/">TinyMCE HTML Editor</a>
          by <a href="https://www.ephox.com/">Ephox</a>. We would like to thank
          them for open-sourcing the project, and making a such feature-rich and useful
          website component available to web sites like ours.
        </p>
